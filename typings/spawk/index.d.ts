  /**
   * Intercept and mock a call to child_process.spawn. Returns a Interceptor object, see below for more info. Parameters
   * are defined as follows:
   *
   * @param command Command to intercept and mock. Can either be a string, a RegExp, or a function. The interceptor will
   *   mock a given call if the string matches exactly, or the RegExp matches, or the function returns true. The
   *   function will be passed three parameters: the command, args, and options passed to `child_process.spawn`. The
   *   function will be called under the context of the Interceptor, so you will have access to the methods and
   *   attributes described below.
   * @param arguments Optional arguments that must accompany the given command in order to be mocked. Can either be an
   *   array or a function. The interceptor will mock a given call if the array matches exactly, or if the function
   *   returns true. The function will be passed one parameter: the args passed to `child_process.spawn`. The function
   *   will be called under the context of the Interceptor, so you will have access to the methods and attributes
   *   described below.
   * @param options Optional options that must accompany the given command in order to be mocked. Can either be an
   *   object or a function. The interceptor will mock a given call if all of the attributes in these options match, or
   *   if the function returns true. If an object, only the attributes you give are matched, others do not affect
   *   whether or not it matches. If a function, it will be passed one parameter: the options passed to
   *   `child_process.spawn`. The function will be called under the context of the Interceptor, so you will have access
   *   to the methods and attributes described below. When generating stdin/stdin/stdout streams for the interceptor, if
   *   the call to spawn specifies inherit for their modes they will be mapped to process.stdin etc.
   *
   *   By default, any calls to spawn that do not match an existing mock will pass through to the original spawn. See
   *   `preventUnmatched` for more info on how to change this. Each intercepted call will only be used once, so if you
   *   want to intercept multiple calls to the same command you need to call spawk.spawn for each call you want to be
   *   intercepted. They will be used in the order that they were created.
